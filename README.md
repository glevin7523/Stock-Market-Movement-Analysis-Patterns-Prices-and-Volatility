# 📈 Stock Market Movement Analysis

> Unlocking patterns, trends, and volatility from historical stock data through data analysis and visualization.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project dives deep into stock market datasets to uncover **key insights about price movements, trading volumes, and volatility**. Using data science techniques and visual storytelling, it answers essential questions about how stocks behave across industries, tickers, and time periods.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Details

- **Source**: `stocks.csv`
- **Scope**: Historical price data from multiple companies
- **Includes**: 
  - Daily open, high, low, close prices
  - Trading volume
  - Company tickers and industries
  - Market capitalization and exchange info

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing of stock market data  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with high-impact visuals  
- 🧮 Feature extraction from dates and market behavior  
- 🔥 Correlation heatmaps to identify impactful variables  
- 📉 Volatility and trend assessment per company and sector  
- 🧪 Predictive modeling using regression (for closing prices)  
- 📋 Automated report generation for rapid profiling  

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- The majority of stocks show a strong correlation between **open**, **close**, and **volume**.
- Certain industries and companies exhibit **distinct volatility trends**.
- Linear models offer a baseline for predicting stock prices, but room for advanced models (like LSTM) exists.
- Seasonal and annual patterns were extracted from the **Date** field to analyze market behavior over time.

---

## 📷 Visualizations

> A few of the insights are represented with:
- Distribution plots of stock prices  
- Industry-wise volume comparison  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Volatility trends by ticker and year  
- Word clouds and categorical summaries via profiling reports

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python (pandas, numpy)** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visual analytics  
- **Scikit-learn** – Regression & preprocessing  
- **YData Profiling** – Automated exploratory analysis  

---

## ✅ How to Use

1. Clone this repository  
2. Place your `stocks.csv` in the project directory  
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook to run the analysis  
4. Review the visual output and final insights  

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements

- Integrate **live stock APIs** for real-time predictions  
- Implement **time-series models** (ARIMA, LSTM)  
- Classify short-term price direction (Up/Down)  
- Deploy as an interactive **Streamlit web app**
