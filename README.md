# Stock-Market-Movement-Analysis-Patterns-Prices-and-Volatility
Time-series and statistical analysis of stock data including visualizations, volatility, moving averages, and insights.
📈 Stock Market Movement Analysis: Patterns, Prices, and Volatility
This project explores historical stock market data to identify trends, analyze volatility, and model potential movement patterns. It leverages data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and basic regression modeling techniques to understand stock performance and price behavior.

📦 Dataset
File: stocks.csv

Contents: Daily stock prices and metadata

Features include:

Date

Open, High, Low, Close, Volume

Ticker (company symbol)

Exchange

Industry

Market Cap

🧰 Tools & Libraries
pandas, numpy – data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn – data visualization

sklearn – machine learning & preprocessing

ydata_profiling – automated EDA reporting

📊 Project Workflow
✅ 1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration
python
Copy
Edit
data = pd.read_csv("stocks.csv")
data.head()
data.describe()
Loads and previews the dataset, checking for outliers, ranges, and missing values.

📈 2. EDA: Exploring Price Behavior
python
Copy
Edit
data['Ticker'].unique()
sns.histplot(data['Close'])
data.groupby('Ticker')['Close'].mean()
Identifies unique stocks (tickers)

Analyzes distribution of closing prices

Computes average close price per ticker

🧼 3. Data Cleaning
python
Copy
Edit
data.isnull().sum()
data.dropna(inplace=True)
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
Removes missing and duplicate values to ensure clean input for modeling.

🧠 4. Automated Profiling
python
Copy
Edit
profile = ProfileReport(data, title="Stock Market Profiling Report")
profile.to_file("stock_profile_report.html")
Generates an in-depth EDA report using ydata_profiling.

🧪 5. Feature Engineering
python
Copy
Edit
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data['Year'] = data['Date'].dt.year
data['Month'] = data['Date'].dt.month
Extracts temporal features from the Date column for time-series analysis.

🧪 6. Correlation & Volatility Analysis
python
Copy
Edit
corr = data.corr(numeric_only=True)
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True)
Visualizes feature relationships

Identifies patterns in price movements

⚙️ 7. Predictive Modeling (Linear Regression)
python
Copy
Edit
features = ['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume']
X = data[features]
y = data['Close']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
Trains a linear regression model to predict stock closing prices based on other price features.

📊 8. Model Evaluation
python
Copy
Edit
r2_score(y_test, predictions)
mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
Evaluates accuracy using R² Score and MSE.

🔍 Insights
'Close' price correlates strongly with 'Open', 'High', and 'Low'

Linear regression can predict stock prices decently on historical structured data

Visualization uncovers price distributions, outliers, and industry trends

Some tickers/industries exhibit significantly higher volatility
